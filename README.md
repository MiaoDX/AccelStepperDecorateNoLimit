ATTENTION! This library is still under heavy development.

# AccelStepperDecorateNoLimit

We wrap and extend [`AccelStepper`](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper) to provide more useful functions for our platform, aka `AccelStepperDecorateNoLimit` and `MultiStepperDecorateNoLimit`.

Compared with [AccelStepperDecorate](https://github.com/MiaoDX/AccelStepperDecorate), this library do not consider corresponding LIMIT control, so much more clean. By far, I prune from the `AccelStepperDecorate` library, more functions are meant to add.

### Usage

Refer to [AccelStepperDecorate](https://github.com/MiaoDX/AccelStepperDecorate).
